### About

Composer's Reference is a open-source web application with a singular mission: to get relevant music theory constructs into the hands of composers, songwriters, and improvisors as quickly, and effortlessly, as possible.

Composer's Reference is meant to serve as the ultimate companion app to the songwriting process so that users can spend less time figuring out which common elements will work with what they've already written and more time discovering the unique sounds that will elevate their music to the next level.

Composer's Reference takes a lot of cues from music theory resources that exist on the internet today, but strives to take the content into the new decade with an elegant user interface that makes it easy to select your context and get your results without leaving a single webpage.

Composer's Reference values consistency and conciseness over inundating users with an untenable number of possibilities. The scales, modes, and chords supported by Composer's Reference have been deliberately chosen to provide a complete sense of what's musically possible without undermining the practicality of working within a theoretical model.

Composer's Reference, in its current form, serves as the foundation for a comprehensive, music theory application resource. It is provided under the GNU General Public Licsence v3.0. Support its development on GitHub.

Composer's Reference is created and maintained by [Konstantin Kuzmin](www.konstantinkuzmin.com), a software developer and composer from Minneapolis, Minnesota.
